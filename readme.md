#Xavier University

##Master Email Template

The master email template is based off of the [Ferio Email Template](http://themeforest.net/item/ferio-responsive-email-mailbuild-online/11945346) which 
was purchased for use by all Xavier University e-mail communications.

*This template is to be a starting point for all official university communications.*

**Reminder:** Images will need to have absolute sourcing. Xavier logos and social icons have been sourced to use the Xavier website.
